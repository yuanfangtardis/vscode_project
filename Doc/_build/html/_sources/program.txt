EasyScan_HEP is an **Easy**-to-use tool to **Scan** the parameter space for high energy phyics(**HEP**) models.

It includes four scan methods(random, grid, MCMC, MultiNest), some popular data analysis algorithm (Bayes anlysis, CLs) and a well defined framwork to connect to high energy physics programs. With only few necessary input parameters(one page), users can easly get visiable results with different scan methods.
