This distribution contains machine-readable text files corresponding
to the analysis and results of PRL, 115, 231301. These files can be
divided into three categories:

===============================
=== Dark Matter Constraints ===
===============================
Number of files: 6
File naming: limits_<channel>.txt
Description:
    Upper limits on the DM annihilation cross section versus mass for
    individual targets and the combined analysis of 15 dwarf galaxies.
    Note that individual targets limits are profiled with respect to
    the J-Factor uncertainty of the respective dwarf galaxy in the
    same way as done in the combined analysis.
    
Structure:
    Column [0]:    Dark matter particle mass (GeV)
    Column [1-25]: Constraints on <sigmav> derived
        from each dwarf galaxy with a kinematically
        determined J-factor.
    Column [26]:   Constraints on <sigmav> derived
        from a combined analysis of 15 dwarf galaxies.

================================
===  Bin-By-Bin Flux Limits  ===
================================
Number of files: 1
File naming: bin_by_bin_limits_<type>.txt
Description:
    Bin-by-bin upper limits for each dwarf galaxy on the integral
    (type=eflux) and differential (type=e2dfde) flux.  Both
    calculations model the flux distribution within an energy bin as a
    power-law with index=2.

Structure:
    Column [0-1]: Minimum and maximum energy edges of each bin
        (MeV).        
    Column [2-27]: Energy flux upper limit (MeV cm^-2 s^-1;
        type=eflux) or E^2 times the differential flux upper limit
        (MeV cm^-2 s^-1; type=e2dfde) derived from each dwarf galaxy
        in the energy bin specified by Columns [0-1].

================================
===  Bin-By-Bin Likelihoods  ===
================================
Number of files: 25
File naming: like_<dwarf>.txt
Description:
    These files contain likelihood functions for each dwarf derived 
    energy-bin by energy-bin, tabulated as the delta log-like value 
    for 25 different values of the energy flux of a putative dwarf source.
Structure:
    Column [0-1]: Minimum and maximum energy edges of each
        bin (MeV).        
    Column [2]: Energy flux (MeV cm^-2 s^-1) of a putative dwarf
        source integrated over the specified bin.        
    Column [3]:   Delta log-likelihood as a function of
        the energy flux of the source

=========================
===  Example Scripts  ===
=========================
Also included in this directory are a set of example scripts to 
aid with a few potential usage cases. These scripts are merely 
meant to illustrate how to operate with the data included here 
and *DO NOT* represent a rigorous analysis, nor do they constitute 
a fully fledged interface to the data themselves. A brief 
description of the examples is included below.

example1.py -- This example demonstrates how to load 
               and plot the dark matter limit files.
example2.py -- This example demonstrates how to load
               and plot the bin-by-bin likelihood limits.
example3.py -- This example demonstrates how to load
               the bin-by-bin likelihood functions and a 
               gamma-ray spectrum and compute spectrally-
               dependent dark matter limits on the 
               annihilation cross section.
               NOTE: This script *DOES NOT* incorporate 
               uncertainties on the measured J-factor.
