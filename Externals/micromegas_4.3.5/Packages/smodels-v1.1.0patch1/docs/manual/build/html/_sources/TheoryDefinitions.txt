Simplified Model Definitions
============================

The so-called `theory module <../../../documentation/build/html/theory.html#theory>`_ contains the basic tools necessary for decomposing the input model
(either in LHE or SLHA format) into simplified model |topologies| and using the output of the decomposition
to compute the :ref:`theoretical prediction <theoryPredictions>` for a given :ref:`experimental result <ExpResult>`.


The applicability of SModelS is currently restricted to models which contain a Z\ :sub:`2` 
symmetry (R-parity in SUSY, K-parity in UED, ...) and result in a
missing transverse energy (MET) final state at experiments. This is required in
order to provide a clear structure for the simplified model topologies appearing
during the :ref:`decomposition <decomposition>` of the input model.
Below we describe the basic concepts and language used in SModelS
to describe the simplified model topologies.

.. _element:

Elements
--------

A simplified model topology representing a specific cascade decay of a pair of BSM states produced in
the hard scattering is called an element in the SModelS language.
Elements contain the final states (Z\ :sub:`2`-even) particles appearing in
the cascade decay as well as the masses of the BSM (Z\ :sub:`2`-odd) states
which have decayed or appear in the last step of the decay.
A representation of an element is shown below:


.. _elementscheme:

.. image:: images/elementB.png
   :width: 30%
   
An element may also hold information about its corresponding 
weight (cross section times branching ratio times efficiency). [*]_
The overall properties of an element are illustrated in the scheme below:

.. _topscheme:

.. image:: images/topSchemeB.png
   :width: 35%

SModelS works under the inherent assumption that, for collider purposes,
all the essential properties of a BSM model can be encapsulated by its
elements.
Such an assumption is extremely helpful to cast the theoretical predictions of a
specific BSM model in a model-independent framework, which can then be compared
against the corresponding experimental limits.
For instance, as shown in the :ref:`scheme above <elementscheme>`, only the
masses of the BSM states are used and other properties, such as their spins or
other quantum numbers are ignored (the PID's are, however, stored for book-keeping).


Below we describe in more detail the element properties and their implementation
in SModelS.


* **Elements are described by the** `Element Class <../../../documentation/build/html/theory.html#theory.element.Element>`_    


.. _vertex:

Vertices
^^^^^^^^
Each Z\ :sub:`2`-odd decay is represented by a vertex containing its final states (one Z\ :sub:`2`-odd
state and the Z\ :sub:`2`-even particles), as shown in the :ref:`scheme above <topscheme>`.

.. _final states:

Final States (Z\ :sub:`2`-even)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Final states indicate all Z\ :sub:`2`-even states coming out of a vertex (see :ref:`scheme above <topscheme>`).
In most cases, these correspond to Standard Model particles (electrons, gauge bosons, Higgs,...).
Note that, if the input model contains BSM states which are Z\ :sub:`2`-even (such as additional Higgs bosons),
these also appear as final states.
In contrast, stable or long-lived Z\ :sub:`2`-odd particles which might appear in the detector (either as MET or charged tracks)
are *not* classified as final states.


* Z\ :sub:`2`-even **states are defined (and can be easily modified) in** :download:`particles.py <images/particles.py>` 

.. _odd states:

Intermediate States (Z\ :sub:`2`-odd)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Z\ :sub:`2`-odd states are always assumed to consist of BSM particles with Z\ :sub:`2`
conserving decays of the form: (Z\ :sub:`2`-odd state) :math:`\rightarrow`  (Z\ :sub:`2`-odd state') + |final states|.
The only information kept from the intermediate states are their masses (see :ref:`scheme above <topscheme>`).
If an intermediate state is stable and neutral, it is considered as a MET signal.

* Z\ :sub:`2`-odd **states are defined (and can be easily modified) in** :download:`particles.py <images/particles.py>`

.. _branch:

Branches
^^^^^^^^

A branch is the basic substructure of an |element|.
It represents a series of cascade decays of a single initial Z\ :sub:`2`-odd
state.
The diagram below illustrates an example of a branch.

.. image:: images/branchTopB.png
   :width: 25%

The structure of each branch is fully defined by its number of vertices and the number of 
|final states| coming out of each vertex. 
Furthermore,  the branch also holds the information about the particle labels for the |final states|
coming out of each vertex and the masses of the :ref:`intermediate states <odd states>`,
as shown below.

* **Branches are described by the** `Branch Class <../../../documentation/build/html/theory.html#theory.branch.Branch>`_   


.. _notation:

Element Representation: Bracket Notation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The structure and final states of |elements| are represented in textual form using a nested brackets
notation. The scheme below shows how to convert between the graphical and bracket representations of an element:


.. _bracketnotation:

.. image:: images/bracketNotationB.png
   :width: 50%

The brackets are ordered and nested in the following way. 
The outermost brackets correspond to the :ref:`branches <branch>` of the |element|.
The branches are sorted according to their size (see :ref:`element sorting <elementsorting>`) 
and each branch contains an *ordered* list of :ref:`vertices <vertex>`.
Each vertex contains a list of the |final states| (sorted alphabetically) coming out of the vertex.
Schematically, for the example in the :ref:`figure above <bracketnotation>`, we have::

   element = [branch1, branch2]
      branch1 = [vertex1]
         vertex1 = [l+,l-]
      branch2 = [vertex1,vertex2]
         vertex1 = [l+]
         vertex2 = [nu]

Using the above scheme it is possible to unambiguously describe each |element| with a simple list of nested brackets.
However, in order to fully specify all the information relative to a single |element|, we must
also include the list of :ref:`intermediate state <odd states>` masses and the element weight.
The :ref:`intermediate state <odd states>` masses can also be represented by a mass array
for each branch, as shown below:

.. _massnotation:

.. image:: images/massNotationB.png
   :width: 65%
   
.. _topology:

Topologies
----------

It is often useful to classify |elements| according to their
overall structure or topology.
Each topology corresponds to an *undressed*
|element|, removed of its
|final states| and Z\ :sub:`2`-odd masses.
Therefore the topology is fully determined by its number of
branches, number of vertices in each :ref:`branch <branch>` and number of
|final states| coming out of each :ref:`vertex <vertex>`.
An example of a topology is shown below:

.. image:: images/globTopB.png
   :width: 25%

Within SModelS, elements are grouped according to their
topology. Hence  topologies represent a list of elements sharing a
common basic structure (same number of branches, vertices and
final states in each vertex).

* **Topologies are described by the** `Topology Class <../../../documentation/build/html/theory.html#theory.topology.Topology>`_   

.. [*] In order to treat the UL and EM map results on the same footing,
   SModelS applies a trivial binary efficiency to elements for UL-type
   results as will be explained in detail later.
