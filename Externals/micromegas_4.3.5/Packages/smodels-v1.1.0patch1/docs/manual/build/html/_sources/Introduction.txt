Introduction

(From the original SModelS paper, `arXiv:1312.4175 <http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1312.4175>`_ )

Searches at the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC show no signs of physics
beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  After the first phase of LHC operation at
centre-of-mass energies of 7–8 TeV in 2010–2012, the limits for the masses of
supersymmetric particles, in particular of 1st/2nd generation squarks and
gluinos, have been pushed well into the TeV range [1,2]. Likewise, precision
measurements in the flavor sector, in particular in B-physics, are well
consistent with Standard Model (SM) expectations [3,4] and show no sign, or
need, of new physics. At the same time the recent discovery [5,6] of a
Higgs-like particle with mass around 125 GeV makes the question of stability of
the electroweak scale—the infamous gauge hierarchy problem—even more imminent.
Indeed, supersymmetry (SUSY) is arguably the best-motivated theory to solve the
gauge hierarchy problem and to explain a light SM-like Higgs boson. So, the
Higgs has very likely been discovered—but where is supersymmetry?  

Looking closely [7–12] one soon realizes that many of the current limits on SUSY
particles are based on severe model assumptions, which impose particular
relations between particle masses, decay branching ratios, etc. The prime
example is the interpretation of the search results within the Constrained
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). The interpretation of the search
results within a much more general realization of the MSSM is perfectly
feasible, see [7,8,13], but computationally very demanding and certainly not
suitable for a “quick” survey.  

An approach which has therefore been adopted systematically by the ATLAS and
CMS collaborations, is to interpret the results within so-called Simplified
Model Spectra [14,15]. Simplified Model Spectra, or SMS for short, are
effective-Lagrangian descriptions involving just a small number of new
particles. They were designed as a useful tool for the characterization of new
physics, see e.g. [16,17]. A large variety of results on searches in many
different channels are available from both ATLAS and CMS, providing general
cross section limits for SMS topologies. However, using these results to
constrain complex SUSY (or general BSM) scenarios is not straightforward.  In
this paper, we present a method to decompose the signal of an arbitrary SUSY
spectrum into simplified model topologies and test it against all the existing
LHC bounds in the SMS context. 
 
This document describes the computer package that does all this.
SModelS can be used just like an application, running :ref:`runSModelS.py <runSModelS>`.
In addition, SModelS is also usable as a :ref:`library <exampleCode>`, providing functionality to

 * decompose models into simplified models,
 * confront input models with LHC constraints,
 * compute LO, NLO, NLL SUSY cross sections,
 * identify missing topologies,
 * browse the SModelS database of SMS results
 * and a few more tasks.

For example code for various tasks, see :ref:`Examples`
