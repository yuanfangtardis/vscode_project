This is the changelog of the Lilith library.
For the changelog of the database of experimental results, see data/changelog

** Feb. 14, 2015: v1.1, first official release

** Mar. 10, 2015: v1.1.1, correction of a minor bug in the Lilith C API
                  (the Python Lilith library was not found depending on
                   the location of the main source file)

** Apr. 14, 2015: v1.1.2, list of possible final states and reduced couplings 
                  supplemented by muon-muon

** Aug. 11, 2015: v1.1.3
		  * File containing the bibtex references to the latest experimental
                    results added; data/latest-references.txt
                  * Common coupling "ll" grouping both "mumu" and "tautau" added
                  * Correction of a bug in the reduced coupling mode that made the
                    the use of the "ZH" and "WH" couplings not possible
                  * Correction of a bug that made the code exit in the case that both
                    the "LO" and "BEST-QCD" precisions were used in a single run in the
                    reduced couplings mode, thanks to Sushruth Malaridharan

** June, 2016: v1.1.4
		  * Hidden modifications for the interface to micrOMEGAs
		  * 2HDM fit routine added
