As for other micrOMEGAs models, compile the UMSSM as
		make main=main.c
and execute the code after specifying the file containing the input parameters
		./main umssm.par

In main.c (note that a fortran version main.F is also available) :

To compute the UMSSM spectrum : 
		err=sortOddParticles(cdmName);
Then to check if there is an error in computing the spectrum :
		if(err) {printf("Can't calculate %s\n",cdmName);} 

To use LEP limits on sparticles :
		if(masslimits()!=0) {printf(" LEP limits not satisfied \n");}
		
To use LHC limits on the new gauge boson :
		if(Zprimelimits()==0) {printf("LHC limits on new Zprime OK\n");}

To compute low energy and Higgs physics observables :
Use UMSSMTools which contain an adaptation of several routines of NMSSMTools :
		err=umssmtools(PDG_LSP);
-> Output in SLHA format : - UMSSM_inp.dat		
			   - UMSSM_spectr.dat
			   - UMSSM_decay.dat
			   - SM_decay.dat

Major update from

with B-physics observables at full NLO also adapted to UMSSMTools.


The following command displays the warning messages from UMSSMTools :
		slhaWarnings(stdout);
They are also printed in UMSSM_spectr.dat. The following warning messages can be given :

To get the loop-improved Higgs branching ratios from UMSSMTools (useful before computing relic abundance for instance) use : slhaRead("UMSSM_decay.dat",0);


First public version (v1.0.1) : 4 august 2015.
v1.0.2 : 27 november 2015 -> Interface created so that slha files can now be used as input.
			     The only elements needed are the ones placed in UMSSM_inp.dat, the following command can be used : "./main UMSSM_inp.dat".
v1.0.3 : 25 january 2016  -> New limits from LHC Run at 13 TeV on the new Zprime added.
			     Bug in lilith.c removed. Routine to compute invisible width of the Z1 boson removed as a more general one is now available
			     in ../sources.
v1.0.4 : 8 june 2016      -> Several small updates, especially on main.F and routines related to it.
			     Now the routine to compute constraints on the Zprime is in ../sources.
v1.0.5 : 30 june 2016     -> Model files updated to include couplings needed for the computation of dijet constraints on the Zprime.
v1.1.0 : 7 august 2016    -> Major update. New features for NMSSMTools_4.9.3 adapted to the UMSSM :
			     B-physics observables at full NLO (from F. Domingo, arXiv:1512.02091 [hep-ph]);
			     New B-physics observables with b -> d gamma, B_d -> mu+ mu-, b -> s nu_L nubar_L and b -> c tau nu_tau;
			     New tests of K-physics in Kphys.f with K -> pi nu_L nubar_L, Delta M_K and eps_K;
			     CKM, experimental and lattice input updated;
			     bsg.f renamed as Bphys.f given the number of B-physics observables computed by this routine;
			     Update on Higgs constraints, muon/strange quark loops added to h_i/h_A -> gamma gamma;
			     Treatment of BR(h_i -> invisible) modified : PDG of the LSP automatically given to UMSSMTools
			     -> BR(h_i -> invisible) computed only if LSP = lighest neutralino or lighest RH-sneutrino.
			     In main.c "printHiggs(stdout);" now gives the corrected Higgs widths from UMSSMTools.
v1.1.1 : 5 october 2016   -> Bug fixes + new features from NMSSMTools_5.0.0 adapted to the UMSSM. 
			     Some files/libraries renamed; lhchig.f removed, its content is included into subexp.f.
v1.1.2 : 4 november 2016  -> NMSSMTools_5.0.1 adapted to the UMSSM + bug removed during compilation (library umssmtools called now umssmtoolslib).
